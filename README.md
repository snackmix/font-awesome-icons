## About Project
A JSON file of all recent (5.13.0) icons to be used within other applications.

The data is taken from [their icons metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/master/metadata/icons.json) and stripped down to a simpler version.

**The following has been removed**
- changes
- svg
- ligatures
- voted

Also the `styles` array has been changed to include the icon class with it.
